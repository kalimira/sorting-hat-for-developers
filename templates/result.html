    {% if house == "Gryffindor" %}
      Where dwell the brave at heart. Courage, responsibility and the will to act when others hesitate.
    {% elif house == "Ravenclaw" %}
      A mind sharp as a blade. Curiosity, logic and the need to understand before acting.
    {% elif house == "Hufflepuff" %}
      Those who value loyalty, fairness and leaving the world better than they found it.
    {% elif house == "Slytherin" %}
      Ambition, strategy and the desire to shape outcomes rather than react to them.
